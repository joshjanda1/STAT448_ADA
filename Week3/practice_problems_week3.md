# Week 3 Practice Problems

You should be able to complete **Problems 1-5** in 30 minutes or less with R syntax inside of an Rmd file. **Problem 6** asks you to redo the same problems in SAS, which should also take less than or equal to 30 minutes.

***

**#1** Using R, import the CCSO Bookings Data with the URL. Rename the data object as "ccso".

***

**#2** With R, create a new subset of the CCSO Bookings Data that:  
  - creates a new variable "hoursserved" that records the time spent in jail in hours (this variable does not already exist)  
  - creates a new variable "yearsserved" that records the time spent in jail in years  
  - filter so that we only keep observations that are hoursserved > 24.  
Now, show only the first 10 rows of the subset and the variables: hoursserved, employment status, race, sex, and released reason.

***

**#3** Recreate the plot below in R code and give an accurate analytical/statistical description of the plot.

**#4** Recreate the plot below in R code and give an accurate analytical/statistical description of the plot.

**#5** Are the male and female distributions of `days in jail` far from normal? You must show the QQplot for both groups and answer the question in words.

***

**#6** Redo all problems above in SAS using a new ipynb file.
